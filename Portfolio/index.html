            <h2>About</h1>
            <p>Well, I’ve been working on mobile app development for four years
                now, while still studying at college. Had my own projects, coded
                mostly in Java and Python, but my account on the play store got
                suspended, for reasons I still fail to understand. But I learned
                a lot, both at school and while working on the apps. Now I am
                looking to get a job with an innovative game studio, and am glad
                to be interviewing with you here. Apart from coding, I enjoy
                reading a good book, or a nice evening out with friends. That
                would do for a short introduction, please tell me if you’d like
                me to elaborate on anything from my education, or experience
                with apps. <br> <br>
                My name’s Ron, I’m 34, have worked as a software engineer for a
                smaller company, in an agile team, working mostly on online
                maps, with Java and C++. But just like many other startups this
                one eventually hasn’t taken of, and now I find myself
                unemployed. I prefer to work in a smaller team, and see the
                direct impact I have on a project, which is the reason no. 1 why
                I am applying for the job with you. Other than that I am more or
                less an ordinary guy, with a girlfriend and a dog, and a passion
                for model trains. Is there anything else you’d like to know
                about my life at the moment? <br><br>
                My name is Khatia, 22, still a student, looking for a part time
                job I can do while still at school, ideally working remotely.
                I’m skilled with PHP and Java, and I am trying to learn other
                programming languages, step by step. Have two brothers, both of
                them study at a med school, so it is quite funny that I, as a
                girl, decided for software engineering. I try to get the most
                out of my time at the college, and have some edge once I
                graduate, which is the primary reason why I seek a part time job
                with you. <br>
                <br>

                Jason here, 41, experienced programmer with several successful
                projects under my belt. I’d say my portfolio introduces me
                better than my words do, so if want we can look at it together,
                and I can tell you about the principal projects I engineered
                over the years. I am a lucky father of two and quite a family
                man, trying to find a good life-work balance. It is one of the
                reasons why I sit here with you today, because the expectations
                of the managers in my last job were extreme–they wanted me to
                work for 70+ hours each week, which is something I could not
                accept, having a family and life outside of work. <br><br>
                My name’s Nicole, I’ve been working in one of the BIG 4
                companies for seven years, climbing the career ladder, learning
                the ins and outs of programming. I still feel young though, and
                I got tired of working on the same tasks and application month
                after month, which is often the case in big corporations. Didn’t
                feel I was growing professionally, and I am looking for a
                radical change in my career. I hope to find what I am looking
                for in your startup, and I am ready to bring onboard everything
                I’ve learned in the big corp. <br><br>
                I would introduce myself in seven words. Passionate coder,
                responsible father, best colleague ever. That pretty much sums
                it up, though at least the last one my former colleagues have to
                confirm. I try to do a good job in all roles I have in life, and
                I enjoy the process immensely. Do you want me to talk about my
                coding skills and experience now, or will we discuss it later in
                the interview? <br><br>
                I’d introduce myself as a dreamer. I dream of working at Google,
                working on applications billions of people use, having an impact
                on the world with my work. Sure enough, I know you receive
                hundreds of job applications for every single job opening, and I
                am not the only dreamer waiting for his chance. But I will try
                to convince you in this meeting that I am the one who deserves a
                chance to prove his skills in the job
